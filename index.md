# Welcome to the JBD Lab!

<br>
The research in our lab focuses on bacterial immune systems – including CRISPR-Cas and beyond – through a phage lens. We are interested in investigating the functions of these systems in bacteria that naturally encode them. We study the mechanisms by which they function and how phages fight back to antagonize or evade them.

We are a part of the [UCSF Department of Microbiology and Immunology](http://microbiology.ucsf.edu/), [UCSF Integrative Microbiology (iMicro) Program](https://imicro.ucsf.edu/) and [UCB Innovative Genomics Institute](https://innovativegenomics.org/). We are located in the fog-free and sunny Mission Bay campus of the University of California, San Francisco.
