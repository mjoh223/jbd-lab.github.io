<h1 id="join-the-jbd-lab">Join the JBD Lab</h1>
<p>The JBD Lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, socioeconomic status, political affiliation, caregiver or family commitments, age, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, mental or physical ability, and learning styles. We are committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming lab environment and believe that everyone should be invited to, and deserves, a seat at the table.</p>
<h5 id="read-more-about-our-mission-and-core-values">Read more about <a href="/jbd-lab.github.io/compact/">our mission and core values.</a></h5>

<p>We’re always looking for passionate, curious, and capable people to join our lab even if the position is not currently advertised. We strive to provide excellent training in molecular genetics and microbiology. Please send your CV/Resume to <a href="joseph.bondy-denomy@ucsf.edu">Dr. Joe Bondy-Denomy</a>. <!-- Currently we have **open positions** for people with the following skills: [Specialist](https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/JPF03325) who will engage in research projects and also manage daily wet lab operations. -->
<br /></p>

<h2 id="graduate-students">Graduate Students</h2>

<p>Students can only apply to a single <a href="https://graduate.ucsf.edu/programs">UCSF graduate program</a> and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of the Ph.D. program, students will rotate through ~3 labs before choosing a thesis lab. The Bondy-Denomy Lab typically has space for 1-2 rotation students every quarter and 1-2 graduate students per academic year. At the end of the third rotation period, we will talk with each student about their interest in joining the lab and then we will make a collective decision based on the availability of lab resources, fit with lab culture and values, and current or proposed scientific projects.</p>

<p>To date, the graduate students from the Bondy-Denomy Lab have participated in the <a href="https://bmi.ucsf.edu/">Biological and Medical Informatics</a>, <a href="https://bms.ucsf.edu/">Biomedical Sciences</a>, and <a href="https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/">Tetrad</a> Graduate Programs, but we welcome trainees from all graduate program affiliations. Currently, the lab is a core member of the following programs:
•	<a href="https://bms.ucsf.edu/">Biomedical Sciences</a>: The UCSF Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Program is an interdisciplinary graduate research program that seeks to equip students with the training and research tools to study the function of tissue and organ systems in development, physiology, and disease.
•	<a href="https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/">Tetrad</a>: Tetrad program provides training in the fundamental principles of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry and the use of these principles to practice the scientific method across disciplines and with rigor.</p>

<h2 id="postdoctoral-fellows">Postdoctoral Fellows</h2>

<p>Interest in Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to <a href="joseph.bondy-denomy@ucsf.edu">Dr. Joe Bondy-Denomy</a>. Postdoctoral Fellow candidates are encouraged to communicate the reason behind their interest in our lab and to be aware of opportunities for extramural funding and support.</p>

<h2 id="other-visitors">Other Visitors</h2>

<p>The Bondy-Denomy Lab welcomes high school and undergraduate interns, post-baccalaureate researchers, foreign exchange students, and sabbatical visitors from academia or industry. If there is another opportunity or position of interest, please reach out as we are open to additional arrangements. We believe in fair compensation for your work, so we do not have volunteer positions.</p>
