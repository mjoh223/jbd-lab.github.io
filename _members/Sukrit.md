description: "Sukrit is a Damon Runyon Fellow in the Bondy-Denomy lab. Sukrit is developing a computational and experimental platform to systematically explore phage-encoded strategies for interfering with bacterial cells. Complex interactions in prokaryotic communities (such as the gut microbiome) can often lead to genetic information being exchanged, modified, and reused by competing species. Using comparative genomics he hopes to discover new biological processes that might have been missed by classical approaches. Prior to the Bondy-Denomy lab, he was a postdoc in Jonathan Weissman’s lab at UCSF, where he worked on pooled CRISPRi screening methods to investigate dengue-virus infections in monocyte derived dendritic cells, and led an oceanic viral survey that doubled the number of known RNA viruses in the biosphere.

Sukrit obtained his PhD in [Andy Fire’s Lab](https://firelab.sites.stanford.edu/) at Stanford where he discovered CRISPR adaptation to RNA, a novel mode among the handful of known mechanisms for reverse flow of genetic information from RNA into DNA genomes, including those employed by retroviruses, telomeres, retrotransposons, mobile group II introns, and phage diversity generating elements. A PCR standardization method he developed during his PhD also formed the basis of a new Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) for monogenic disorders such as thalassemias, cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. Prior to his fellowship at UCSF, he was co-founder and chief scientific officer of BillionToOne Inc., where he designed and led two clinical trials for determining the efficacy of this NIPT method for ß-thalassemia and Down’s syndrome. BillionToOne currently markets this test worldwide, and is on the Y-Combinator Top Companies List.

Sukrit was an undergraduate at Princeton, and a obtained an MPhil as a Gates Scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge."
