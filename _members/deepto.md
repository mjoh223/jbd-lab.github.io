description: "Deepto joined the Bondy-Denomy Lab in September 2021 as a post-doctoral scholar. Prior to his post-doctoral adventures, Deepto was a Ruth L Kirschstein (NRSA) Graduate student in [Prof. Alanna Schepartz's lab](https://schepartzlab.com/) at Yale/ UC Berkeley. Driven by his fascination with phages, bacteria, and their ever-inspiring time-immemorial battle for survival (read: treasure-trove of biotechnological application waiting to happen!), Deepto hopped across the pond for his post-doc research. At UCSF, Deepto is working with the Bondy-Denomy and David Agard labs to study the molecular underpinnings of THE MOST potent anti-immune mechanism used by jumbo-phages to thwart bacterial defenses. In his spare time, Deepto loves to write, photograph birds, host barbecues, dabble in trivia, play basketball, solve puzzles/ the NYT daily crossword and bake."
