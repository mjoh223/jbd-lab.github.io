description: "Yuping joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in October, 2019 as a postdoctoral scholar. Yuping was a graduate student in the [Sherlock Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sherlocklab/) and [Petrov Lab](http://petrov.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. Her Ph.D. work focused on understanding evolutionary processes quantitatively using S. cerevisiae. Originally from China, Yuping got her undergraduate degree in Bioinformatics at Huazhong University of Sci. & Tech., China, where she worked with Dr. Yu Xue on the computational construction of the lysine acetylation network. After her undergraduate, Yuping was interested in learning how to conduct biological experiments and worked as a research technician with Dr. Hong Zhang at National Institute of Biological Sciences, China, to study developmental biology in C. elegans. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, Yuping is working on discovering new bacterial immune systems against a special group of phages – the jumbophages – and understanding the mechanisms of such immune systems. Outside the lab, Yuping likes climbing rocks, running trails, hiking the wilderness and looking funny in her VR headset trying to master VR games."
