description: "Alex Hong joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in July 2021 as a graduate student in the Tetrad program. Alex grew up in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas before attending MIT. There, he worked in [Dr. Hazel Sive’s Lab](http://sivelab.wi.mit.edu/) on mapping cerebrospinal fluid directional flow in embryonic zebrafish. After graduating with a degree in Biology, Alex worked in [Dr. Kevin Esvelt’s Sculpting Evolution Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/sculpting-evolution/people/) on optimizing a high-throughput microinjection system for making transgenic C. elegans and establishing a CRISPR-Cas mediated daisy drive system in C. elegans. With his interests now directed towards new bacterial immune systems, Alex is working on studying the mechanism of the anti-phage system Gabija. Outside of research, Alex enjoys basketball/soccer, painting, singing, hiking, and biking."
