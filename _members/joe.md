description: "Joe is an Associate Professor at UCSF, in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology. Joe went to the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) for his undergrad in Biology (Microbiology specialization) and spent time as a co-op student in labs at Western University (London, ON) and McGill University (Montreal, QC). Joe then attended the University of Toronto to complete his PhD in [Alan Davidson's lab](http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidsonlab/Davidson_Lab/Home.html) where he studied interactions between bacteriophages and their host bacteria, focusing on the effects of lysogeny and the CRISPR-Cas immune system. In 2015, Joe started the lab at UCSF as a Faculty Fellow and in November of 2017, became an Assistant Professor. In July of 2020, he was promoted to Associate Professor, with tenure.

The lab is currently focused on studying the interactions between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts, attempting to discover and characterize the bacterial immune systems that protect bacteria and the strategies that phages use to fight back."
