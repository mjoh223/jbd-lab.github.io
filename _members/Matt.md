description: "Matt is a bioinformatics PhD candidate working on discovering novel prokaryotic immune systems and anti-immune proteins. He grew up in northern Illinois and graduated from Louisiana State University with a B.S. in biological sciences. After graduate he worked as a research associate at the Rowland Institute at Harvard in the [Brucker lab](http://bruckerlab.org) where he studied microbiome-host behavior associations in Nasonia wasps. In the Bondy-Denomy Lab, Matt uses computational methods to predict and characterize the defense arsenal in bacteria. He is supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org), [UCSF IMSD](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/imsd), and [UCSF Discover](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program) fellowships"
