description: "Januka is a postdoc in the Bondy-Denomy lab dissecting the immune biology of Acinetobacter baumannii using Cas3 technology, although his one true love remains Sulfolobus solfataricus. Januka hails from tropical Sri Lanka, he grew up in the suburbs of London and considers himself equally Scottish since he obtained both his undergraduate and PhD degree from the University of St Andrews in the cold north. Consequently, you’ll see him skipping merrily about when it’s dark and cold in San Francisco. Januka completed his PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Malcolm White](https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/malcolm-white(7d4c564b-948c-4c1f-ae76-50e5da2ced93).html), focusing on type III CRISPR-Cas systems and cyclic nucleotide signaling and discovered a new class of enzyme called ring nucleases. In his free time, he likes to re-watch old sci-fi movies, discover new independent films, catch up with friends, drink tea while mulling over whether Alan Hollinghurst or Hanya Yanagihara is the better author, and take care of his tropical fish."
