description: "Erin Huiting is a Biomedical Sciencesgraduate student and joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in July 2020. Erin grew up in the mountains of Evergreen, Colorado and pursued a degree in Molecular Biology at Colgate University (sadly, she did not receive any free toothpaste). Prior to and following graduation, she worked at the NIH studying the persistence of HIV reservoirs and anti-viral host immunity, as well as the efficacy of HIV cure strategies in human clinical trials, within the lab of [Drs. Tae-Wook Chun and Anthony Fauci](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/lab-immunoregulation). As an [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Fellow in the Bondy-Denomy lab, Erin will continue studying immunology and host-pathogen interactions. She is excited to study new bacterial immune systems within native host organisms, especially uncovering how the cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) works in
Pseudomonas. In her spare time, Erin is involved in gender equity advocacy, exploring the outdoors, or playing/watching soccer."
