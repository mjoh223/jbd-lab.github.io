description: "Alexis Villani joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in July 2021 as a graduate student in the Tetrad program. Alexis grew up in sunny Orange County, CA; no sorry, itâ€™s not like the show (The OC). She attended Orange Coast College where her incredible professors encouraged her to pursue research; then transferred to UC Irvine where she focused her degree in Immunology. During her undergrad, she spent a summer working on yeast prions in the [Jarosz Lab](https://jarosz.stanford.edu/research/) at Stanford; which fueled her interest in protein biology. After graduating, she went on to do a Post-Baccalaureate program at Penn, working in [James Shorter's Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/shorterlab/); there she studied RNA and protein phase separation in the context of neurological disease. In the Bondy-Denomy lab, she is studying the mechanisms by which bacteria inactive their restriction-modification systems. Outside of research she enjoys spending time with her rambunctious toddler and partner, exploring museums, running, buying cute shoes, drinking LOTS of espresso, cooking, and making cocktails!"
