description: "Héloïse Carion joined the Bondy-Denomy lab in June 2021 as a Junior Specialist. Héloïse grew up near the beaches of La Jolla, California. She attended UC Berkeley, where she studied Bioengineering with a concentration in Synthetic and Computational Biology. There, she worked in [Dr. Adam Arkin’s Lab](https://arkinlab.bio/) on characterizing single-gene phage lysis proteins. Building on her interest in viral dark matter, she is now investigating the role of accessory phage genes in the phage-host arms race. In her free time, Héloïse enjoys sunbathing, handstands, and searching for the best California burrito the Bay Area has to offer."
